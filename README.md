## Transparency 📢

This project is completely transparent and honest, before we started we contacted and discussed this project with the authors and admins of the October project. We have given the links to this repo to the authors and we continue to be transparent throughout the whole process! We feel it's important to state this and be open from day one! This repo contains one module, of many other modules all dedicated to different sections of the Summer CMS upgrade proposal. Instead of writing ideas and suggestions, we have taken a pro-active approach and are actively coding a fully working solution! The code is held on private repo's, due to the code being heavily developed and changed on a daily basis. We will release a stable test release to the admins and authors in private for feedback before releasing to the general public for beta-testing. This is a long-term project and we will continue to grow!

Over years we have coded and created well over a hundred pull requests (under various github accounts) which have been merged to the October core, we have never asked or recevived any money for any of the pull requests. We use the cms for professional purposes and therefore it is beneficial for our companies to have a professional working solution to give to our end-users and clients. In order for us to delivery a high quality product we made the discussion to update the cms with new and exciting features and modernize old and existing features, there are breaking change!

<p align="center"><img src="https://github.com/summercms/sc-parser-module/blob/master/assets/images/data.jpg"></p>

## Introduction ⭐

The parser module can be used either in browser (client-side) or in Laravel php (server-side) environment. The parser module is used by other Summer CMS modules (such as the [Security module](https://github.com/summer-cms/sc-security-module)) and in conjunction with custom Summer CMS API's to help process the data.

## Goals :soccer:

This module aims to identify the following details:

- Browser
- Layout engine
- Operating system
- Device
- Model
- Brand
- Platform
- Architecture
- Device pixel ratio (dpr)
- Device memory
- Viewport width
- Geo location
- Ip address
- Internet service provider (isp)
- Autonomous system number (asn)
- Hostname
- Host
- Referer
- Request
- Time Zone

(*) Note: The list above is not an extensive and complete list, it is intended to give a broad overview.

## Privacy Issues :sparkles:

The parser module follows strict privacy regulations set out in the GDPR, ePrivacy and California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA). 

### Consent options ✔️

The parser module allows users to give full consent options set out by the [Legal module](https://github.com/summer-cms/sc-legal-module).

### Data rentention 🗄️

There are options to configure the data retention period and the parser module follows the data retention policy.

### IP anonymization (or IP masking) 🌎

The IP anonymization/masking takes place as soon as data is received by the parser module, before any storage or processing takes place.

<p align="center"><img src="https://github.com/summercms/sc-parser-module/blob/master/assets/images/ip.png"></p>

### Sensitive data 📒

The following personal data is considered **sensitive** and is subject to specific processing conditions:

- Personal data revealing racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs.
- Trade-union membership.
- Genetic data, biometric data processed solely to identify a human being.
- Health-related data.
- Data concerning a person’s sex life or sexual orientation.

(*) Currently the parser module doesn't collect any personal data that is considered **sensitive** to be extra compliant to the rules.

### Encryption 🔒

Article 32 of the GDPR includes encryption as an example of an appropriate technical measure, depending on the nature and risks of your processing activities. Encryption is a widely-available measure with relatively low costs of implementation. The data processed by the parser module is encrypted before being stored.

## Privacy as Default 👀

The Summer CMS takes privacy and user data seriously, we strongly believe in putting the user first and being fully transparent! Below lists some major components. However, for a full list see the legal module section here: https://github.com/summercms/sc-legal-module#goals-soccer

### General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) 🔔

<p align="center"><img src="https://github.com/summercms/sc-parser-module/blob/master/assets/images/gdpr.jpg"></p>

The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) is one of the most wide-ranging pieces of legislation passed by the EU in recent memory. It was introduced to standardise data protection law across the single market and give people in a growing digital economy greater control over how their personal information is used. Summer CMS has a dedicated legal module to easily complie with current laws and sets the `opt-out` as the default and allows webmasters and users can then `opt-in`.

### ePrivacy Regulation 🔔

<p align="center"><img src="https://github.com/summercms/sc-parser-module/blob/master/assets/images/eprivacy.jpg"></p>

The ePrivacy Regulation will complement the GDPR’s general rules on personal data processing by providing specific rules governing electronic communications.

As such, the ePrivacy Regulation will take precedent over the GDPR in situations where both laws apply.

Note that, unlike the GDPR, the ePrivacy Regulation does not apply to just personal data. It also affects, for instance, B2B marketing.

Summer CMS has a dedicated legal module to easily complie with current laws and sets the `opt-out` as the default and allows webmasters and users can then `opt-in`.

### California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) 🔔

<p align="center"><img src="https://github.com/summercms/sc-parser-module/blob/master/assets/images/ccpa.jpg"></p>

The California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) is a law that allows any California consumer to demand to see all the information a company has saved on them, as well as a full list of all the third parties that data is shared with.

Businesses are subject to CCPA if they meet the requirements of having gross annual revenues of more than $25 million; buy, receive or sell the personal information of 50,000 or more consumers, households or devices in California; or derive 50% or more annual revenue from selling consumers' personal information.

The CCPA requires business privacy policies to include information on consumers' privacy rights and how to exercise them: the Right to Know, the Right to Delete, the Right to Opt-Out of Sale and the Right to Non-Discrimination.

Summer CMS has a dedicated legal module to easily complie with current laws and sets the `opt-out` as the default and allows webmasters and users can then `opt-in`.

### Strong Customer Authentication (SCA) 🔔

<p align="center"><img src="https://github.com/summercms/sc-parser-module/blob/master/assets/images/sca.png"></p>

Strong Customer Authentication (SCA) is a new European regulatory requirement to reduce fraud and make online payments more secure. To accept payments and meet SCA requirements, you need to build additional authentication into your checkout flow.

Summer CMS has a dedicated legal module to easily complie with current laws and customize secure settings and sca notices.

### The Second Payment Services Directive (PSD2) 🔔

<p align="center"><img src="https://github.com/summercms/sc-parser-module/blob/master/assets/images/psd2.jpg"></p>

The Payment Services Directive Two (PSD2) is a piece of legislation designed to force providers of payment services to improve customer authentication processes and to also bring in new regulation around third-party involvement.

Summer CMS has a dedicated legal module to easily complie with current laws and customize secure settings and sca notices.

### Federated Learning of Cohorts (FLoC) 🔔

<p align="center"><img src="https://github.com/summercms/sc-parser-module/blob/master/assets/images/floc.png"></p>

FLoC enables ad selection without sharing the browsing behaviour of individual users. A site should be able to declare that it does not want to be included in the user's list of sites for cohort calculation. Summer CMS puts it's users privacy first and so sets the `opt-out` as the default, webmasters and users can then `opt-in`. This also passes GDPR/ePrivacy laws.

FLoC is part of a suite intended to bring targeted ads into a privacy-preserving future. But the core design involves sharing new information with advertisers. Unsurprisingly, this also creates new privacy risks.

The first issue is fingerprinting. Browser fingerprinting is the practice of gathering many discrete pieces of information from a user’s browser to create a unique, stable identifier for that browser.

The second problem is less easily explained away: the technology will share new personal data with trackers who can already identify users. For FLoC to be useful to advertisers, a user’s cohort will necessarily reveal information about their behavior.

### Cookies 🔔

<p align="center"><img src="https://github.com/summercms/sc-parser-module/blob/master/assets/images/cookie.svg" width="250" height="250"></p>

Cookies in Summer CMS auto detect if the cms is being hosted from a secure connection and sets the following default for https connections:

Attribute | Default Value | Description
---|---|---
Prefix | `__Secure-` | Set to `__Secure-` automatically on `secure` connections and not `__Host-` to allow subdomains.
Expires | session: `1 day`, modules: `3 months` | The main cms session cookie is set to a `single day`, the cookies for modules are set longer at `3 months`. End-users can change the cookie expiry dates of all cookies using the legal module on the frontend. Allowing Summer CMS to be fully compliant with GDPR and ePrivacy laws.
Max-Age | lifetime: `120`, expire on close: `false` | This can be setup and changed using the config file `session.lifetime` value. 
HttpOnly | `true` | Forbids JavaScript from accessing the cookie. This can be setup and changed using the config file `session.http_only` value. 
Secure | `true` | Cookie is only sent to the server when a request is made with the `https:` scheme (except on localhost) and therefore is more resistent to `man-in-the-middle` attacks. This can be setup and changed using the config file `session.secure` value. 
SameSite | `Lax` | Controls whether a cookie is sent with cross-origin requests, providing some protection against cross-site request forgery attacks (CSRF). This can be setup and changed using the config file `session.same_site` value. 
SameParty | `none` | This is currently an Origin Trial in Chrome 89 and greater browsers only. Adding `SameParty` to a cookie that would otherwise be subject to the "[Lax](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-httpbis-rfc6265bis-05#section-5.3.7.1)" or "[Lax-allowing-unsafe](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-west-cookie-incrementalism-01#section-3.1.1)" enforcement modes of `SameSite` weakens security properties by expanding the set of contexts in which the cookie may be accessed. This can be setup and changed using the config file `session.same_party` value. 

#### SameParty Cookie Attribute 🍪

**A `SameParty` cookie is included in an HTTP request if the origins of the requested URL and all of the ancestor frames in the target browsing context belong to the same First-Party Set.** For example, a top-level navigation will always send `SameParty` cookies. Note that requests are treated the same regardless of the HTTP method (GET, POST, etc.), and the origin of the request initiator does not factor into whether the `SameParty` cookie should be allowed.

For example, suppose that owner.example owns a First-Party Set containing {member1.example, member2.example}. Then a `SameParty` cookie set by member1.example **would be sent** to https://member1.example in the following contexts:

<p align="center"><img src="https://github.com/summercms/sc-parser-module/blob/master/assets/images/same_party_table.png"></p>

## Vanilla Code 🍦

<p align="center"><img src="https://github.com/summercms/sc-parser-module/blob/master/assets/images/vanilla.jpg"></p>

Vanilla often refers to **pure** or **plain**. So in terms of programming languages, it means either without the use of **3rd party libraries** or without the use of **frameworks**.

The `core` files and `modules` in Summer CMS use `Laravel`, an open-source PHP web framework. However, all the styling, javascript and data interchange formats have been written using `vanilla` code. This makes upgrading the code **quick** and **simple** without the constraints of relying solely on a single library or framework! Plus reducing the code size and optimizing the performance by reducing the overheads of loading third-party libraries (such as jQuery as an example). Summer CMS treats all third-party libraries and frameworks as optional extras and developers are welcome to use any of them to enhance their websites and applications using Summer CMS.

The [framework module](https://github.com/summer-cms/sc-framework-module) adds bridges and interconnects different frameworks to Summer CMS with ease to give a customized experience for each framework!

## Naming Prefix ✒️

**Summer CMS uses the `sc-` naming prefix to advoid conflicts.**

## Requirements 🚩

This module has been optimized to work with php `7.4.x` and `8.x.x` versions - we recommend upgrading from any lower php version.

**A full list of requirements to install Summer CMS, can be found here: [Summer CMS Requirements](https://github.com/summer-cms/sc-main/blob/main/README.md#requirements-).**

## Big data 📊

This module uses several Big Data tool sets to analyze large amounts of data collected from various Big Data sources to help detect and categorize. Some database sizes are in the petabytes and takes a few hours to run and process some models. These models are then used in our tests to improve the parsers detection rate. We also have various non-disclosed test severs running to gather various data and run tests to process the test data. This process helps us to build a more accurate parser module and helps to speed up the build process. We fully rely on using large amounts of data to build an accurate working parser used by some of the other Summer CMS modules!

[![Edit with Gitpod](https://gitpod.io/button/open-in-gitpod.svg)](https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/summercms/sc-parser-module)

## PSR ♻️

This parser module uses some PSR standards to be the most interoperable possible:

- [PSR-1](https://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-1/) Basic Coding Standard.
- [PSR-2](https://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-2/) Coding Style Guide.
- [PSR-6](https://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-6/) Caching Interface.
- [PSR-7](https://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-7/) Standard interfaces to represent http requests, responses and uris.
- [PSR-16](https://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-16/) Common Interface for Caching Libraries.
- [PSR-17](https://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-17/) Standard factories to create PSR-7 objects.
- [PSR-18](https://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-18/) Standard interface to send a http request and return a response.

We also suggest using Cross-browser testing provided by BrowserStack (*) where a real-browser can't be used in-house.

<p align="center"><img src="https://github.com/summercms/sc-parser-module/blob/master/assets/images/browser-stack.png"></p>

## PHP Coding Standards Fixer ⭕

The PHP Coding Standards Fixer (PHP CS Fixer) tool fixes your code to follow standards; whether you want to follow PHP coding standards as defined in the PSR-1, PSR-2, etc., or other community driven ones like the Symfony one.

### Installation 🔹

The recommended way to install PHP CS Fixer is to use [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/download/) in a dedicated `composer.json` file in your project, for example in the
`tools/php-cs-fixer` directory:

```bash
$ mkdir --parents tools/php-cs-fixer
$ composer require --working-dir=tools/php-cs-fixer friendsofphp/php-cs-fixer
```

For more details and other installation methods, see: [PHP-CS-Fixer](https://github.com/FriendsOfPHP/PHP-CS-Fixer).

### Usage 🔸

Assuming you installed PHP CS Fixer as instructed above, you can run the following command to fix the files PHP files in the `src` directory:

```bash
$ tools/php-cs-fixer/vendor/bin/php-cs-fixer fix src
```

(*) Change the above command to the correct folder location.

### Testing ⚙️

The Parser module uses the following:

- A [PHPUnit](https://phpunit.de) test suite.
- A coding style compliance test suite using [PHP CS Fixer](http://cs.sensiolabs.org/).
- A code analysis compliance test suite using [PHPStan](https://github.com/phpstan/phpstan).

To run the tests, run the following command from the project folder.

```bash
$ composer test
```

## Semantic Versioning 🎁

The Summer CMS and all modules use: [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).

<p align="center"><img src="https://github.com/summercms/sc-parser-module/blob/master/assets/images/semver.png"></p>

Semantic Versioning is a 3-component number in the format of `X.Y.Z` where:

- X stands for a major version.
- Y stands for a minor version.
- Z stands for a patch.

The goal of Semantic Versioning is to bring some sanity to the management of rapidly moving software release targets. As discussed above, 3 numbers i.e, `Major`, `Minor` and `Patch` are required to identify a software version. For example, if we take version `5.12.2`, then it has a `major` version of 5, a `minor` version of 12 and a `patch` version of 2.

Below are some scenarios when Summer CMS creates a new version release:

- Bump the value of X when breaking the existing API.
- Bump the value of Y when implementing new features in a backward-compatible way.
- Bump the value of Z when fixing bugs.

Pre-release metadata is identified by appending a hyphen to the end of the Semantic Versioning sequence. Thus a pre-release for version 1.0.0 could be `1.0.0-alpha.1`. Then if another build is needed, it would become `1.0.0-alpha.2` and so on. Note that names cannot contain leading zeros, but hyphens are allowed in names for pre-release identifiers.

Summer CMS uses the following pre-release metadata:

| Version     | Description        |
| ----------- | ------------------ |
| 3.3.x-aplha | The alpha phase of the release life cycle is the first phase of software testing. |
| 3.3.x-beta  | The beta phase follows after the alpha phase. A Beta phase generally begins when the software is feature complete but likely to contain a number of known or unknown bugs. |
| 3.3.x-rc    | A release candidate (RC), is a beta version with potential to becoming a stable product and is ready to release unless significant bugs emerge. |
